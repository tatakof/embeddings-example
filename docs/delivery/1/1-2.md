## Requirements
- `app/chat/page.tsx` renders chat UI.
- Reusable `ChatBubble` and `SourceDrawer` components in `components/chat/*`.
- Stream assistant tokens as they arrive.
- Scroll to bottom on new message.
- Cite sources with hover or expandable panel.

## Implementation Plan
1. Scaffold page route in Next.js App Router.
2. Components: `ChatBubble`, `ChatInput`, `SourcesPanel`.
3. Use `EventSource` or fetch streaming reader.
4. Tailwind styling akin to modern messengers.

## Verification
- Manual: send message, see streaming, sources listed.
- Lighthouse check for accessibility contrast.
